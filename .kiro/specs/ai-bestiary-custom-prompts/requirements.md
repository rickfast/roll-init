# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing AI Generated Bestiary functionality by allowing users to provide additional custom prompts when generating monsters. Currently, the AI generation only uses basic parameters (name, challenge rating, alignment, type), but users often want to specify additional creative details like appearance, behavior, special abilities, or thematic elements to make their monsters more unique and tailored to their campaigns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Dungeon Master, I want to provide additional descriptive prompts when generating a monster, so that I can create more unique and thematically appropriate creatures for my campaign.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is on the stat block form with AI generation enabled THEN the system SHALL display an optional text area for additional prompts
2. WHEN the user enters text in the additional prompt field THEN the system SHALL preserve this text during form interactions
3. WHEN the user clicks "Generate with AI" with additional prompts provided THEN the system SHALL include the custom prompt text in the AI generation request
4. WHEN the AI generation completes successfully THEN the system SHALL populate the form with the generated stat block that incorporates the additional prompt details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Dungeon Master, I want the additional prompt field to be clearly labeled and provide helpful guidance, so that I understand how to effectively use this feature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the stat block form THEN the system SHALL display a clearly labeled text area for additional prompts
2. WHEN the user focuses on the additional prompt field THEN the system SHALL display placeholder text with examples of useful prompt types
3. WHEN the user hovers over or focuses on the prompt field THEN the system SHALL provide helpful tooltip or description text explaining how the prompts will be used

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Dungeon Master, I want the additional prompts to be optional, so that I can still use the basic AI generation without being required to provide extra details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user leaves the additional prompt field empty THEN the system SHALL still allow AI generation using only the basic parameters
2. WHEN the user generates a monster without additional prompts THEN the system SHALL function exactly as it currently does
3. WHEN the user provides additional prompts THEN the system SHALL enhance the generation request without breaking existing functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Dungeon Master, I want the additional prompts to be integrated seamlessly into the existing generation process, so that the user experience remains smooth and intuitive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user provides additional prompts THEN the system SHALL maintain the same loading states and error handling as the current implementation
2. WHEN AI generation fails with additional prompts THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages without losing the user's prompt text
3. WHEN the user edits a monster that was generated with additional prompts THEN the system SHALL preserve the form state and allow regeneration
4. WHEN the user switches between edit mode and generation mode THEN the additional prompt field SHALL remain accessible and preserve its content
